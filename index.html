      <h2>Welcome</h2>      
      <p>
        I am Dumitru Craciun, a C# developer focused on creating full desktop solutions, automated data workflows, and SQL-integrated systems.<br>
        I design and build complete applications end-to-end WinForms or console apps, database structure and file processing to UI development, automation, and system integration.<br>
        This website was fully developed by me using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and serves as a clean, lightweight presentation of my work.
      </p><br>

      <h3>What I Do</h3>
      <ul class="features">
        <li>Build fast and reliable WinForms desktop applications</li>
        <li>Create automated data pipelines (SFTP, validation, processing)</li>
        <li>Design SQL-based systems with reporting and logging</li>
        <li>Develop tools that replace manual work with full automation</li>
        <li>Integrate systems using CSV, XML, SQL, APIs, and custom formats</li>
        <li>Develop reusable C# libraries (.dll) for shared functionality</li>
        <li>Send automated emails using secure API-based integration</li>
      </ul><br>

      <h3>Explore My Work</h3>
      <p>
        Feel free to explore the programs listed in the navigation above.  
        Each one is an end-to-end software solution I designed to automate
        real business workflows and solve complex data challenges.
